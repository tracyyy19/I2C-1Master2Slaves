# I2C-1Master2Slaves
In this I2C communication setup, a single Arduino serves as the master device, while two other Arduinos act as slaves. The master is designed to receive data from each of its slaves and send individualized responses. Each slave Arduino, upon request from the master, sends a string data message to express affection for the master.
